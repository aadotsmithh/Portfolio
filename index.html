<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>Greetings! My name is Andre Smith and I am a practicing full stack engineer with <strong><em>THINKFUL</em></strong>.</p>
    
        <p>My current location is St. Paul, MN where I am also a full-time manager with Enterprise Rent-A-Car inside the MSP airport at Terminal 1. </p>

<!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <article>
      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Before entering the <strong><em>THINKFUL</em></strong> program, I was a former collegiate athlete at the University of the Pacific. Being part of the Men's DI Basketball program was an amazing leadership experience and ultimately strengthened my teamwork involvement.</p>

        <p>While working toward my degree, I had taken an intro to software engineering course which largely opened my interest in this career field.</p>

        <p>After some time working in the field of customer service, I realized I still had an itch to learn the skills to coding. Researching more about the career path, I am now finding myself more interested than ever with THINKFUL. Being a former leader in my athletic stages to now being a leader in the customer service field, I believe my communication and teamwork skills would transition phenomenally in the coding enviornment.</p>
